## Steps I am to take

## Hypotheses formulated
1. (Check) Sales of products as per province or state?
2. One of the states has an emerging trend in demand of a certain product.
3. Corporate customers are more likely to purchase higher value items compared to home office customers.
4. Orders marked as high or critical have higher than average sales due to quick delivery which improves customer satisfaction.
